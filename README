NAME
    Sys::Command - run system commands from Perl

VERSION
    0.01. Development release.

SYNOPSIS
        use Sys::Command qw/run spawn/;
        use strict;

        # Run and give me all the output, raise exception on error:
        my $output = run('git','status');

        # Give me individual lines instead
        my @output = run('git','status');

        # Manually set working directory, environment and input
        $output = run(qw/git commit -F -/, {
            input => 'text',
            env   => { GIT_DIR => '/some/path/.git' },
            dir   => '/some/path/',
        });

        # Set defaults for a command you call many times:
        my $git = Sys::Command->new(
            cmd => ['git'],
            env   => { GIT_DIR => '/some/path/.git' },
            dir   => '/some/path/',
        );

        # Exactly same as third run above
        $output = $git->run(qw/commit -f -/, {input => 'text'})

        # Low-level access to the underlying process
        my $process = spawn('other','command');
        my $stdout  = $process->stdout;

        print "text" $process->input;
        my @lines = <$stdout>;

        $process->close;
        print "Process exited with value: ". $process->exit;

DESCRIPTION
    Sys::Command allows you to call out to external commands from Perl.
    run() and spawn() are exported on demand.

    run(@cmd) -> $output
        This method is a convenience wrapper around new() for those who
        prefer DBI-style construction.

    spawn(@cmd) -> Sys::Command::Process
        Dependencies removed, etc. The API changed enough to almost give
        this
